      <p>The last location Magellan arrived at was the Phillipines. He died at the battle of Mactan. The surviving crew members split into two ships, one which sailed West which eventually returned to Spain. The other ship sailed East and had many troubles before being captured and jailed by the Portuguese.</p>
